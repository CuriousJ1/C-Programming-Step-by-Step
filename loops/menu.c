/**

When the program executes it will work in the following way:
You must accomplish all the menu options and validation checkings exactly as asked.

---- MENU ----
1. Find factorial
2. Find a^b
3. Quit

What you want to do? 1
Enter number: -1
Invalid number for factorial

---- MENU ----
1. Find factorial
2. Find a^b
3. Quit
What you want to do? 1
Enter number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120

---- MENU ----
1. Find factorial
2. Find a^b
3. Quit

What you want to do? 20
This program can find factorials only in the range 0 - 10

---- MENU ----
1. Find factorial
2. Find a^b
3. Quit
What you want to do? 2
Enter a: 2
Enter b: 5
2^5 = 32.0

---- MENU ----
1. Find factorial
2. Find a^b
3. Quit
What you want to do? 5
Invalid menu option

---- MENU ----
1. Find factorial
2. Find a^b
3. Quit
What you want to do? 3

*** Thank you ***

NOTE: You should use library function pow to find a^b, no need to write code 
for finding a^b.

		// get the response into option variable.
		// Now. you can use if-else to check the option and do needful
		// When option == 3, you need to do something with the variable quit, think
		// about that.  	
		// When option == 1, you should read n and first check the validity,
		// if n < 0, a particular message has to be printed, when n > 10, another 
		// message has to be printed (see the expected output above), if n is valid
		// write a while loop to calculate the factorial and print it, becareful about
		// the initial value of p.
		// for option == 2, read base and exponant then make a call to the pow function
		// print the return value using printf. You may declare a variable to hold the 
		// result.
